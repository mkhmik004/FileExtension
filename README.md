# FileExtension
A program that prompts the user for the name of a file and then outputs that file’s media type if the file’s name ends, case-insensitively, in any of these suffixes:  .gif .jpg .jpeg .png .pdf .txt .zip . If the file has any other extensions or no extensions, the program will output 'application/octet-stream'
